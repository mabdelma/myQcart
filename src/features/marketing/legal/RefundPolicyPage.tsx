      <S n={1} title="Subscriptions">
        <p>
          Paid plans are billed in advance and renew automatically for the same period until cancelled. Your
          billing date is the day you first subscribed.
        </p>
      </S>

      <S n={2} title="Cancelling">
        <p>
          You can cancel at any time from your account's billing settings. Cancellation stops the next renewal;
          your plan stays active until the end of the current paid period, after which it will not renew.

          'Subscription fees are generally non-refundable, and we do not provide refunds or credits for partial periods, unused time, or unused features.',
          'Where required by applicable consumer law, or in cases of a confirmed billing error or duplicate charge, we will provide a refund or credit.',

      <S n={4} title="Free trials">
        <p>
          If a free trial is offered, you will not be charged during the trial. To avoid being billed, cancel
          before the trial ends. Once the trial converts to a paid subscription, the refund terms above apply.

      <S n={5} title="Guest orders &amp; payments">
        <p>
          Payments guests make to a Merchant (for food, rooms, or other goods and services) are between the guest
          and that Merchant. Refunds for those transactions are handled by the Merchant under its own policy;
          Qlisted only provides the technology used to process them.

        <p>
          If you believe a charge is incorrect, please contact us first so we can help resolve it quickly.
          Initiating a chargeback without contacting us may result in suspension of the account while the dispute
          is reviewed.
