      <S n={1} title="Who we are">
        <p>
          Qlisted is a hospitality operations platform owned and operated by {LEGAL_ENTITY}. For any
          business that uses Qlisted to run its restaurant or hotel (a "Merchant"), the Merchant is the
          controller of its guests' personal data and Qlisted acts as a processor on the Merchant's behalf.
          For our own account holders and website visitors, Qlisted is the controller.
